# Chess.com - Front End Programming Challenge

Hey! It's me! Kevin! And here is my submission for the Chess.com Front End Programming Challenge.

## Build/Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## About the project

I started with the excellent Vue CLI tool to build the project scaffolding. Additionally, I incorporated Vuex because it's such a joy to work with! Since we do have some need for basic state communication for components, Vuex is an excellent tool to reach for. Alternatively, Vue's event bus system is also easy to use and sufficient for basic state sharing.

Otherwise, all the css was hand written, no UI framework used. The chess board itself uses CSS Grid which is just lovely to use. For the ranks and files, I went with a simple string, could open some quick options for internatonalization.
